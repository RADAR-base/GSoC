**RADAR-base (Remote Assessment of Disease And Relapses)** is an open source platform that leverages data from wearables and mobile technologies. Below is a list of project ideas.

## Project Ideas

### 1. Organization and Project Archival and Export on Management Portal

**Overview:** The [Management Portal](https://github.com/RADAR-base/ManagementPortal) is a component built by the RADAR-base community to manage remote monitoring studies of participants/patients. It helps to manage studies, participants, data-sources and handles authentication and authorization of entities with the help of role based access control. We are working on a newer version of Management Portal aka Management Portal 2.0, which includes some improvements and additional features. The backend application is implemented using Spring Boot and the Frontend application using Angular.

**Dependencies:** [Management Portal 2.0 Release candidate](https://github.com/RADAR-base/ManagementPortal/tree/Mp2.0-rc)

**Current Status**:  At the moment archival of organisation and project entities are not easy or possible in Management portal. The goal of the project is to first implement a way to archive a project. Secondly, extend this archival to organisation level. 

**Goals:**

### 2. aRMT Protocol Generator and Questionnaire Tester

**Overview**: The [RADAR-base Active Mobile app](https://github.com/RADAR-base/RADAR-Questionnaire) (also known as Questionnaire app) is an app used to deliver questionnaires to participants in a study. The app takes in schedule protocols from a protocol repository ([RADAR-aRMT-Protocols](https://github.com/RADAR-base/RADAR-aRMT-protocols)) and questionnaires from a questionnaire definitions repository ([RADAR-REDCap-aRMT-Definitions](https://github.com/RADAR-base/RADAR-REDCap-aRMT-Definitions)).

**Current Status**: At the moment, the questionnaire and protocol JSON files are manually written or generated by external tools. This process is error-prone and less user-friendly.
 
**Goals:** 
The goal of this project is to implement a UI which can be used to generate the JSON file based on user input and store this generated JSON file to be used by the app. The app should be able to adapt the input type user has chosen and render a sample question that would appear on the app (See wireframe below). We should be able to reuse the components created as part of the questionnaire app to build the live rendering.

Questionnaire creation should also support branching logic which is supported by the app.

Second stage of this project is to apply the same to generate protocols. Live rendering is not necessary for this. Optionally, if time permits this can be further extend to validate the protocol by generating schedule used on the enrolment-time of a participant.

**Sample Wireframe:** ![Wireframe](wireframe.png)

| Milestones                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

### 3. Apple HealthKit integration to aRMT App

**Overview**: The [RADAR-base Active Mobile app](https://github.com/RADAR-base/RADAR-Questionnaire) (also known as Questionnaire app) is an active remote monitoring app for collecting Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) e.g. via questionnaires, active tasks and challenges. Active remote monitoring can be used to analyze cognitive behaviors, mental health and overall well-being of an individual or cohort.

**Current Status**: Currently, the platform is able to collect active data by questionnaires through Android and iOS phones. We want to develop and extend the iOS version of aRMT to collect data from Apple HealthKit and send it to RADAR-base server. For this purpose, because in iOS devices we couldn't collect HealthKit data in background, we need to collect data actively by notifying the participant via notifications to start collecting and sending the data. 

**Source Code**: https://github.com/RADAR-base/RADAR-Questionnaire

**Goals:**

| Milestones                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

### 4. IoT Production-Ready Framework

**Overview:**
The [RADAR-IoT](https://github.com/RADAR-base/RADAR-IoT) is a lightweight, flexible, configurable and highly extensible framework for IoT devices (like a raspberry pi)
that allows for capturing sensor data (and potentially other devices) and consuming it in different ways
including sending it to the [RADAR-base mHealth platform](https://radar-base.org/) backend. The gateway framework is highly decoupled and extensible. The architecture is shown below.

![RADAR-IoT Single device multi sensorSample flow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11093544/154696409-2db70900-cd86-4af1-8b6f-e80f40890452.jpg)

Presently, the RADAR-base platform focuses on personal sensing, these devices are typically battery powered and carried on the user.
Wearable devices available for integration are limited by the vendor availability of SDKs and REST-APIs,
however, for static IoT sensors there is a very large range of sensor modalities and providers, a significant improvement to the RADAR-base platform
would enable the use of these sensors opening up a wide array of use cases within the health and other domains.
A single platform to collect, and analyse in real-time, ambulatory personal data (phone active/passive RMT, wearable data)
in parallel with static IoT sensor data provides a holistic 360° view of both personal and environmental state previously not possible.

The IoT gateway framework for RADAR-base differentiates itself from related work by being device, sensor and programming language agnostic,
supporting all types of common IoT input-output protocols, being open-source, modular and easily extensible, providing support for multiple data sinks
(like mHealth platform, on-device AI and ML, dashboard and more), interoperability, providing industry-leading security and medical level privacy,
and providing integration to a well established open-source mHealth cloud platform for data collection, aggregation,
transformation and heavyweight analytics with different types of data sources like wearables, IoT sensors, mobile apps, eCRFs.

**Current Status:**
The framework is currently in the Proof-Of-Concept (POC) stage and has been tested working in a staging environment. There are various integrations including [GrovePi](https://www.dexterindustries.com/grovepi/) and the array of [sensors](https://github.com/RADAR-base/RADAR-IoT/wiki/Supported-Sensors) compatible with it. For more information take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/RADAR-base/RADAR-IoT/wiki).

We want to finalise the framework and make it production-ready.
This will involve working on core aspects of the framework like sensor states machines, M2M communication protocols and
implementing advanced visibility into the framework.

**Goals:**

### 5. Fitbit Web API Subscription and Nutrition API Extension

**Overview:**
The [RADAR-REST-Connector](https://github.com/RADAR-base/RADAR-REST-Connector) contains a [Kafka Connect source connector](https://docs.confluent.io/home/connect/overview.html) for a general REST API, and one for Fitbit in particular. This allows for pulling the wearable data from Fitbit servers using their [Web API](https://dev.fitbit.com/build/reference/web-api/).

**Current Status:**
Currently, the implementation is using a PULL based approach where we make requests chronologically without any knowledge of presence of data on Fitbit's servers. This however comes with caveats:

- There is no way of knowing if there is data present (for a particular time range) on the Fitbit servers or not.
- This makes it hard to keep track of late arriving (or out of order) data since the application needs to keep making requests backwards in time to check. This results in loss of data.
- This also makes the system not real-time.

The solution is to implement the [Fitbit Subscriptions API](https://dev.fitbit.com/build/reference/web-api/developer-guide/using-subscriptions/) (a PUSH based mechanism). In this case, the Fitbit API will send a notification to an endpoint on our application informing when there is new data available. On receiving this notification, we can make request for the specific data provided in the notification hence mitigating the issue stated above.

Another part of extension to this application would be support for new types of data from the Fitbit API.

**Goals:**

### 6. Grafana Dashboards for visualising the data in realtime

**Overview**: The platform uses [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) to visualise the data coming from the devices and apps. A TimescaleDB Kafka connector delivers both active and passive data from the Kafka topics to a TimescaleDB database. Data from the database is then used to visualise data completeness through various [dashboards in Grafana](https://github.com/RADAR-base/RADAR-Grafana). 

![Screen Shot 2022-02-21 at 3 27 47 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16977973/154984871-bce650ce-28ce-40f4-a558-dd60d79ce89d.png)

**Current Status**: Currently, the dashboards that have been created are specific to the studies running them (with specific devices and requirements). These dashboards are added to the [Kubernetes installation](https://github.com/RADAR-base/RADAR-Kubernetes/tree/main/etc/radar-grafana/dashboards/allprojects). For example, one dashboard is called "Fitbit Weartime", which shows the daily number of hours the participant wore the Fitbit device. However, not all studies may be using the Fitbit device. It would be helpful to generalise the dashboards and allow easy configurations.

**Dependencies:** Sample/Mock data will be necessary to create the graphs.

**Goal:**

| Goals | Related Issues | Requirements |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| General Grafana dashboard configurations | - | - The goal is to create different Grafana dashboard configurations for different data/devices and types of visualisations needed. This would make dashboard setup easier and quicker for different studies. This would also allow easy reuse of configurations across studies.

**Required Skills:** Grafana, TimescaleDB

**Good to have:** Go, Kafka, Kafka-connect

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Expected Size:** 175-hour (Half time)

### 7. RADAR-Feature pipeline

**Overview:**

There is a rapidly growing interest in utilizing smartphones and wearables to remotely monitor patients with physical and mental disorders, which offers the potential to provide timely and personalized interventions. Yet, standardization, extraction, and exploration of relevant digital phenotypes (features derived from single or multiple remote monitoring data streams) are time- and effort-consuming. The RADAR-base platform offers off-the-shelf open-source capabilities for collecting these types of remote monitoring streams of data. Standardizing the pipeline for feature extraction and cataloguing will greatly facilitate and expedite the discovery of informative features, enabling feature reuse and comparison.

In [RADAR-pipeline](https://github.com/RADAR-base/radar-pipeline), we are working on an open-source feature extraction pipeline which is capable of processing and analysing raw data collected through smartphones and wearables. The applicable sensor modalities, as detailed by the RADAR-base platform schemas, include GPS, Bluetooth, phone and app usage, sleep, step count, heart rate and others.  We have shown through a [depression case study](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/relationship-between-major-depression-symptom-severity-and-sleep-collected-using-a-wristband-wearable-device(e28ac77e-18f6-43b0-8f73-19da02024f23).html) the functionality and utility of the pipeline. The presented open-source library will reduce burdens for studies aiming to develop relevant digital biomarkers and encourage and facilitate reproducible research. It also provides a standardized framework for contributing new pipelines with an emphasis on reuse.

**Current Status:**

The framework is in development stage, and we are open to new and interesting ideas. We have a working module now and we in the process of finalizing the framework and make it production-ready.

### 8. pRMT plugins with data from Google Sleep API and Google Activity recognition API

**Overview**: The [RADAR-base Passive Mobile App (pRMT)](https://github.com/RADAR-base/radar-prmt-android) is the hub for collecting background sensor data and provides data streams from both on-phone sensors and the capability to collect data from a number of wearable devices. This application depends on plugins to collect information. New wearable devices can readily be connected to the passive app as plugins using a vendor SDK. In this project we want to extend pRMT support for [Google Sleep API](https://developers.google.com/location-context/sleep) data and [Google Activity recognition](https://developers.google.com/location-context/activity-recognition) data as separate plugins.

The Sleep API, a library powered by Google Play services allows apps to determine when the user goes to sleep and wakes up. The Sleep plugin should subscribe and get the updates via Google Sleep API.

The Activity Recognition API automatically detects activities by periodically reading short bursts of sensor data and processing them using machine learning models.

**Current Status**: Currently, project-supported plugins are listed in the plugins directory of [radar-commons-android]().

**Source Code**: https://github.com/RADAR-base/radar-prmt-android and https://github.com/RADAR-base/radar-commons-android
