**RADAR-base (Remote Assessment of Disease And Relapses)** is an open source platform for remote patient monitoring. The main focus of RADAR-base is seamless integration of data streams from various wearables and mobile applications to collect patient generated data in real time and store, manage and share the collected data with researchers for retrospective analysis.

**We use Slack as the main medium of communications.** Join us on Slack by filling out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScKNZ-QonmxNkekDMLLbP-b_IrNHyDRuQValBy1BAsLOjEFpg/viewform) and connect with your potential mentors to discuss your project ideas.

## Project Ideas

The latest list of **project ideas** can be found [here](https://github.com/RADAR-base/GSoC/tree/main/project-ideas_2023). For questions or discussions, please contact us through Slack. **UPDATE RADAR-base is not in GSoC 2023, however if you are interested in any of the projects feel free to get in touch.

## How to apply

## About the RADAR-base platform

RADAR-base provides both passive and active data collection. Passive collection can be done by directly sending data from phone sensors or device sensor data through the (pRMT) app or device sensor data via cloud storage to RADAR-base or combination of these options. Active data collection using the active Remote Monitoring Technologies (aRMT) app, which includes the use of questionnaires that might ask patients about their mood, medication intake, or the severity of symptoms. All of the collected data can be extracted from the platform in structured formats.

Below is a high-level architecture diagram of the platform:

## About RADAR-base community
RADAR-base community consists of software engineers, data scientists, researchers,operations engineers, bioinformaticians. The RADAR-base platform was build and maintained by [The Hyve B.V](https://www.thehyve.nl/) and [PhiDataLab](https://phidatalab.org/) at King's College London under the IMI RADAR-CNS and IMI RADAR-AD project. 

Currently, the platform has been used by many academic institutes and research organizations to conduct remote monitoring studies. Read about the research studies which use RADAR-base [here](https://radar-base.org/index.php/project/).
